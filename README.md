# GearedCameraInC
EPITA S4 project :
 A group consisted of Maxence Crouzy, Yassine Damiri, Thuraya Shanbari and Karim Abou-Dargham, we would like to pitch you our project idea for the fourth semester.
We thought of creating a mechanic support which when attached to a camera, will follow the person being filmed on two axes by the help of the two support platforms. This implies that the person being filmed will be detected and centered after an image treatment, which will be then sent as information to the computer which will then deduce the movement of the camera on its axes.
We hope our project will be accepted by you and we are excited to go on this journey together as a group.
